COVID-19 CASE TIME SERIES PREDICTION MODEL: 

This project uses ARIMA Time Series forecast future trends in the COVID-19 case.


OVERVIEW:

•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, skewness and inconsistencies in the dataset.

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, correlations, and distributions of key variables. 

•	Time Series Forecasting: The Arima time series model is used to predict future trends in case numbers, deaths, and recoveries of the COID-19 Cases. 

•	Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the forecast was evaluated by Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).


•	Code Structure https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report data: Contains the raw and preprocessed data files.

•	notebooks: Colab/Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and modeling.

•	src: Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering.



OUTCOME:

The ARIMA model can make predictions on this case study.
